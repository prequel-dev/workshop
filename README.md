# Problem Detection Workshop

## Overview

This repo contains a collection of setup scripts and scenarios that can be used to demonstrate problem detection.

* [What is problem detection?](https://www.prequel.dev/blog-post/its-time-for-problem-detection)

In this workshop we'll run through several real failure use cases. First, you'll have a chance to unocver these issues with a popular observability solution. Next, we'll give you a preview of the product we're building and show you how we're making it easier for teams to detect and manage problems.

* Scenario 1: OpenTelemetry Collector OOM Crash (CRE-2024-009)
* Scenario 2: Kafka Topic Operator Thread Blocked (CRE-2024-006)
* Scenario 3: RabbitMQ Mnesia overloaded (CRE-2024-007)
